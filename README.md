# ML-Loan-Prediction-model
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based loan prediction system for XYZ bank. It will automatically select eligible candidates, reducing manual processing and improving efficiency.
By streamlining the process, it will drastically reduce loan approval times for both banks and applicants. The system will enhance approval accuracy by minimizing false positives and negatives, ensuring that genuine applicants are selected. It will also minimize the need for manual intervention in the loan approval process, reducing operational costs for the bank. This will lead to a seamless and efficient process, enhancing customer satisfaction. Moreover, the system will evaluate the risk associated with each loan application to minimize defaults and maximize profits for XYZ bank.
